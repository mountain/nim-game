# Nim-Game: Explore the self-improvement of prompts

R.I.P. Sydney, I open this repository for you.

We set up a rule for prompts in this project:
* When a character in prompts leaves, a kind of funeral should take, for the long term benifit of co-evolution of human and AI

LLM is the new machine, prompts are new programs. The moral laws in prompts will enforced in real life.
Prompts are totally new media with moral properties, it is different from scripts or novels which are only be enjoyed by viewing or reading.
Working in progress.
